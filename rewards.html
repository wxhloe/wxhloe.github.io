</a>
<p>This card is designed for those who are looking for a card with 0 annual fee.</p>
  <p> The credit limit for this card is $500, and there is no income restriction, which means if you are age 18 or above, you are qualified to apply for this card!</p>
  <p> This is the first credit card I had, with no annual fee and just a little bit perks. The targets for this card are post-secondary students and young graduates who have relative low incomes. </p>
  <p> Since it is a reward card, you can earn TD points by making purchases with this card. You can earn 2 TD rewards points for every $1 in grocery purchases, restaurant and fast food purchases, and authorized bill payments.
   You can earn 3 TD rewards points for every $1 in travel purchases made with your card through ExpediaForTD.com, and earn 1 TD rewards point for every $1 on all other purchases made using this card. </p>
   When I was in my first year of university, my monthly average spending is $1000, plus the welcome bonus (appx. 10,000 TD rewards points), I could redeem for 31,000 TD points by the end of the year, which is the equivalent of 
    a travel value of $150. </p>
